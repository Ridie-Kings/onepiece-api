Upon his betrayal of the Kurozumi Family, Kaidou dubbed the island New Onigashima, as part of his project to transform Wano into a lawless pirate paradise. Kaidou intended for his son Yamato to take over as its shogun, though Yamato had no desire to do so. However, Wano was liberated after the defeats of both Kaidou and Orochi, and the Kouzuki Family was returned to power with Kouzuki Momonosuke as the current shogun. Before departing Wano, Monkey D. Luffy, the man who dethroned Kaidou, gave a copy of his Jolly Roger to Momonosuke to hang somewhere in the country and announced that if big trouble came, to point to the flag, implying that Wano is allied with and under the protection of the Straw Hat Pirates. Hundreds of years ago, Wano was known as the Country of Gold, being once located at sea level. The Ancient Weapon Pluton is currently located under Mt. Fuji, beneath the old Wano Country.
